Solo entry to Pyweek with theme of Downstream. Got second place!!! Drew all art, composed all music and wrote all code.
You can find my entry here: [https://pyweek.org/e/speedlimit3539/](https://pyweek.org/e/speedlimit3539/)

## Game Concept
Dog in river and picks up gold during gold rush. What are the consequences. Eat fish the survive. Mark Twain says, 'what would life be without his puppy'.

## Some thoughts
What is downstream. At least there is a river, and then rivers are like Californian gold rush. So I make a setting like this with historical inspired music and American golden age movie music. Also followed a lot of Bob Ross tutorials for the background art.
