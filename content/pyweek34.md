# PyWeek 34 - Tasty Red Bean Simulator

This was my solo entry for PyWeek 34, a week-long Python game jam. Theme was "Red planet". I got third place! Like with all my other entries, I drew the art, made music and wrote the code.

## Game Concept
I didn't know what to do with the theme, but it had red, so I thought of red bean deserts. So this game is about making red bean deserts for the inhabitants of a red planet...

## Some thoughts
The point-and-click gameplay is simple and intuitive, and I really worked on voice leading for the music. The resulting game became fun and intense and is one of my personal favorites.
