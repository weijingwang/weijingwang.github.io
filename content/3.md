# Capstone Winter Demo 2

## Technical Implementation Overview

This project represents our second major milestone in developing assistive technology for the visually impaired. The goal is to convert visual information from a camera feed into spatial audio cues that users can hear through headphones.

### How It Works

The system uses computer vision to analyze the camera input and identify objects, obstacles, and spatial relationships in the environment. This information is then translated into a 3D audio soundscape that helps users navigate their surroundings.

### Technical Implementation

- **Computer Vision**: Uses depth mapping and object detection
- **Audio Processing**: Converts spatial data to binaural audio  
- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency system for immediate feedback

This demo showcases significant improvements in accuracy and responsiveness compared to our first iteration.
