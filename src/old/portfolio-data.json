This reduces redundancy and improves compression ratios.\n\n## Implementation Details\n\n- Implemented multiple prediction modes (vertical, horizontal, DC, diagonal)\n- Analyzed prediction accuracy across different image types\n- Measured compression efficiency improvements\n- Compared results with reference implementations\n\n## Results\n\nThe analysis showed that certain prediction modes work better for specific image characteristics - for example, vertical prediction excels with horizontal textures, while diagonal modes are effective for edge regions.",

      "detailedContent": "# Capstone Winter Demo 2\n\nThis project represents our second major milestone in developing assistive technology for the visually impaired. The goal is to convert visual information from a camera feed into spatial audio cues that users can hear through headphones.\n\n## How It Works\n\nThe system uses computer vision to analyze the camera input and identify objects, obstacles, and spatial relationships in the environment. This information is then translated into a 3D audio soundscape that helps users navigate their surroundings.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\n- **Computer Vision**: Uses depth mapping and object detection\n- **Audio Processing**: Converts spatial data to binaural audio\n- **Real-time Processing**: Low-latency system for immediate feedback\n\nThis demo showcases significant improvements in accuracy and responsiveness compared to our first iteration.",
