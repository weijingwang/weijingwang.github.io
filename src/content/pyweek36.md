The second game of team chinkaraoshiman. For the theme of dark matter. We drew the art, made music and wrote code by ourselves all in one week. Featuring art from great artist [KINGEMU246](https://www.kingemulee.com/).

## Game Concept
A point-and-click game where you manage your rat cage, and breed them until there is enough the cover the earth surface... One of the only games to ever use matplotlib in its gameplay.

## Some thoughts
We had a lot of trouble with the theme dark matter, but one thing we thought of was the black plague. And the plague had rats. Rats are matter, so this is what happened.
