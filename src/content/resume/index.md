## Experience

### Shivkumar Chandrasekaran Research Group, UC Santa Barbara — Santa Barbara, CA  
**Graduate Researcher** | Oct 2025 – Present  
- Researching novel AI architectures with low weight norms for robustness against adversarial attacks.

### Goleta Star — Santa Barbara, CA  
**Electrical Engineering Intern (continued part-time during M.S.)** | Jun 2025 – Present  
- Developed a SAR image labeling and recognition pipeline using YOLO-based detection and SAM-based prompt generation for automatic annotation.  
- First-author paper *"YOLOv8 AI model for recognizing objects in SAR imagery"*, accepted for presentation at SPIE Defense + Commercial Sensing 2026.

### CViSion (UCSB ECE Capstone Project) — Santa Barbara, CA  
**Team Lead & Lead Developer** | Sep 2024 – Jun 2025  
- Received Distinguished Technical Achievement in Multidisciplinary Engineering.  
- Led a 12-member team to develop a real-time assistive tool for the visually impaired using YOLOv8, DepthAnythingV2, and HRTF-based spatial audio; benchmarked models for speed and accuracy.

### University of Tokyo — Tokyo, Japan  
**Research Intern** | Jun 2024 – Aug 2024  
- Derived the output of a compact optical comb generator using ring resonators and a time-dependent phase modulator driven by a low-frequency RF signal in Professor Yoshiaki Nakano’s lab.  
- Developed MATLAB simulations to optimize coupling coefficients and ring sizes for the desired comb spectrum.

### Innova Electronics — Irvine, CA  
**Engineering Intern** | Jul 2022 – Sep 2022  
- Analyzed automotive OBD-II DTC data using SQL and k-means clustering; work informed later AI-based fix recommendation efforts.
