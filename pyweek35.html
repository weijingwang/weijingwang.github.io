      <p>This was my first team entry in a long time with team chinkaraoshiman. Our vision is guided by the beautiful goats from India... We got second place!!! We drew the art, made music and wrote code by ourselves all in one week.

<h3>Game Concept</h3>
Kind of a dungeon crawler with levels where you liberate the goats from the animal cruelty goat farm, and you discover what they are doing to those poor creatures. You hide in shadows and have to make it to the exit.
<h3>Some thoughts</h3>
One of the themes was goat... But it didn't win... The theme was "In the Shadows", so we came up with hiding in the goat's shadow to avoid the enemies.
