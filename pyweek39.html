<h3>Game Concept</h3>
Dog in river and picks up gold during gold rush. What are the consequences. Eat fish the survive. Mark Twain says, 'what would life be without his puppy'.
<h3>Some thoughts</h3>
What is downstream. At least there is a river, and then rivers are like Californian gold rush. So I make a setting like this with historical inspired music and American golden age movie music. Also followed a lot of Bob Ross tutorials for the background art.
