<h3>Game Concept</h3>
This game is about the last plant on the deforested earth in the future. In his last moments, a wealthy business person releases the green savior upon the world in hopes to redeem his sinful past. Collect the lights to grow bigger and save the planet.
<h3>Some thoughts</h3>
I had recently played the game Katamari Damacy, and I thought it would be so nice if we made a game that's easy to play, but also satisfying. Skyscrapers are tall. We needed something to grow for our accumulation game mechanics. So then we thought of plants...
<p>I learned blender for this project, and the plants legs were animated in it. The neck physics were done using verlet integration for something like inverse kinematics. The hardest part was unit conversion. Convert meters to pixels. Pixels to meters. And repeat... Also Kingemu's sci-fi art really brought the entire game together.
