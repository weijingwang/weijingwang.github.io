      <p>Over the summer of 2024, I had the opportunity to study abroad in University of Tokyo to work on a new kind of optical comb generator using ring resonators to be used as a part in an optical transmitter reciever pair. We didn't know if it was going to work, but the idea was that it would use low frequency RF voltage for phase modulator, and it would be very energy efficient. I derived an equation for the output and presented it.</p>
