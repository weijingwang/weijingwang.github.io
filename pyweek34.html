      <p>This was my solo entry for PyWeek 34, a week-long Python game jam. Theme was "Red planet". I got third place! Like with all my other entries, I drew the art, made music and wrote the code.
You can find my entry here: <a href="https://pyweek.org/e/speedlimit3534/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://pyweek.org/e/speedlimit3534/</a></p>
<h3>Game Concept</h3>
I didn't know what to do with the theme, but it had red, so I thought of red bean deserts. So this game is about making red bean deserts for the inhabitants of a red planet...
<h3>Some thoughts</h3>
The point-and-click gameplay is simple and intuitive, and I really worked on voice leading for the music. The resulting game became fun and intense and is one of my personal favorites.
